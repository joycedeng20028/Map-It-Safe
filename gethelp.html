    <h1> ABOUT US: </h1>
    <h3>Map It Safe is the newest crime prevention and safety website for the Atlanta area. Our mission is to provide up to date and accurate information and street crime in every neighborhood of the city, so that you can make responsible decisions about where, when, and how to travel in Atlanta.

Our heat map uses state-of-the-art analysis technology from Tableau, pulling from tens of thousands of incidence reports from Atlanta PD, GTPD, and other local law-enforcement agencies. </h3>
<h1> FUTURE PLANS:</h1>
<h3>Our team’s motivation for this project was to make Atlanta a safer place to live in and make traveling around easier and more comfortable for Georgia Tech students in particular but also people in general and we’ve made a innovative way to ensure our users get the information to ensure that they know which times are the the safest to visit which areas, but why stop there?</h3>

<h3>In Fulton County, there is an average of:
4,881 car accidents every month
160 car accidents every day, or
6 car accidents every hour.</h3>
<h3> There were 1,554 fatal accidents in Georgia in 2016. Only 3 other states reported more. So thinking along those lines, our plan to make driving around Atlanta less risky. The way we plan on doing that is actually adding a live GPS feature to our maps and make it navigation based, but in addition to having a colour code for live traffic, we would like to add a color code for how accident prone that street is. We would accomplish this using data science by analyzing say the past 10 years of accident history data involving the location, time, and weather conditions of the accidents and thereby informing the driver where, at what times and during which weather conditions to be more cautious.
Using this we would additionally be able to find the optimum route from point A to point B keeping in mind both factors: time and safety.
</h3>



    <h1> MEET OUR TEAM:</h1>
    <h3> We're committed to improving the safety of commuters by providing people with data on areas with high crime, so that people can make informed decisions when traveling.</h3>
